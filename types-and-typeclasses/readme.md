# Believe the type

Previously we mentioned that Haskell has a static type system. The type of every expression is known at compile time, which leads to safer code.

Unlike Java or Pascal, Haskell has type inference. If we write a number, we don't have to tell Haskell it's a number. It can infer that on its own, so we don't have to explicitly write out the types of our functions and expressions to get things done.

Now we'll use GHCI to examine the types of some expressions. We'll do that by using the :t command which, followed by any valid expression, tells us its type. Let's give it a whirl.


```hs
ghci> :t 'a'
'a' :: Char

ghci> :t True
True :: Bool

ghci> :t (5+5)
(5+5) :: Num a => a

ghci> :t 10   
10 :: Num a => a

ghci> :t "pig"
"pig" :: String

ghci> :t (True, 'a')
(True, 'a') :: (Bool, Char)

ghci> :t 6 == 5
6 == 5 :: Bool
```

Functions also have types. When writing our own functions, we can choose to give them an explicit type declaration. This is generally considered to be good practice except when writing very short functions.

From here on, we'll give all the functions that we make type declarations. Remember the list comprehension we made previously that filters a string so that only caps remain? Here's how it looks like with a type declaration. 

```hs
--removeNonUppercase :: [Char] -> [Char]  
removeNonUppercase :: String -> String 
removeNonUppercase st = [ c | c <- st, c `elem` ['A'..'Z']]  
```

But how do we write out the type of a function that takes several parameters? Here's a simple function that takes three integers and adds them together: 

```hs
addThree :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int  
addThree x y z = x + y + z  
```

Here's an overview of some common types.

- `Int` stands for integer. It's used for whole numbers. 7 can be an Int but 7.2 cannot. Int is bounded, which means that it has a minimum and a maximum value. Usually on 32-bit machines the maximum possible Int is 2147483647 and the minimum is -2147483648. 

- `Integer` stands for, er â€¦ also integer. The main difference is that it's not bounded so it can be used to represent really really big numbers. I mean like really big. Int, however, is more efficient. 

```hs
factorial :: Integer -> Integer  
factorial n = product [1..n]  
```

```hs
ghci> factorial 50  
30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960512000000000000  
```

- `Float` is a real floating point with single precision.

```hs
circumference :: Float -> Float  
circumference r = 2 * pi * r  
```

```hs
ghci> circumference 4.0  
25.132742  
```

- `Double` is a real floating point with double the precision!

```hs
circumference' :: Double -> Double  
circumference' r = 2 * pi * r  
```

```hs
ghci> circumference' 4.0  
25.132741228718345  
```

- `Bool` is a boolean type. It can have only two values: True and False. 

- `Char` represents a character. It's denoted by single quotes. A list of characters is a string. 

- `Tuples` are types but they are dependent on their length as well as the types of their components, so there is theoretically an infinite number of tuple types, which is too many to cover in this tutorial. Note that the empty tuple `()` is also a type which can only have a single value: `()` .

# Type variables

What do you think is the type of the head function? Because head takes a list of any type and returns the first element, so what could it be? Let's check! 

```hs
ghci> :t head  
head :: [a] -> a  

```
Hmmm! What is this `a`? Is it a type? Remember that we previously stated that types are written in capital case, so it can't exactly be a type. Because it's not in capital case it's actually a type variable. That means that `a` can be of any type.

This is much like generics in other languages, only in Haskell it's much more powerful because it allows us to easily write very general functions if they don't use any specific behavior of the types in them. Functions that have type variables are called `polymorphic functions`. 

```hs
ghci> :t fst  
fst :: (a, b) -> a  
```

# Typeclasses 101 

A typeclass is a sort of interface that defines some behavior. If a type is a part of a typeclass, that means that it supports and implements the behavior the typeclass describes. 

A lot of people coming from OOP get confused by typeclasses because they think they are like classes in object oriented languages. Well, they're not. You can think of them kind of as Java interfaces, only better. 

What's the type signature of the == function?

```hs
ghci> :t (==)  
(==) :: (Eq a) => a -> a -> Bool  
```

Interesting. We see a new thing here, the `=>` symbol. Everything before the `=>` symbol is called a **class constraint**. We can read the previous type declaration like this: the equality function takes any two values that are of the same type and returns a `Bool`. The type of those two values **must be a member** of the `Eq` class (this was the class constraint).

Some basic typeclasses:

- `Eq` is used for types that support **equality testing**. The functions its members implement are == and /=. So if there's an Eq class constraint for a type variable in a function, it uses == or /= somewhere inside its definition. All the types we mentioned previously except for functions are part of Eq, so they can be tested for equality.

```hs
ghci> 5 == 5  
True  
ghci> 5 /= 5  
False  
ghci> 'a' == 'a'  
True  
ghci> "Ho Ho" == "Ho Ho"  
True  
ghci> 3.432 == 3.432  
True  
```

- `Ord` is for types that have an **ordering**.

```hs
ghci> :t (>)  
(>) :: (Ord a) => a -> a -> Bool  
```

All the types we covered so far except for functions are part of Ord. Ord covers all the standard comparing functions such as >, <, >= and <=.

- The `compare` function takes two `Ord` members of the same type and returns an ordering. `Ordering` is a type that can be `GT`, `LT` or `EQ`, meaning greater than, lesser than and equal, respectively. 

```hs
ghci> "Abrakadabra" < "Zebra"  
True  
ghci> "Abrakadabra" `compare` "Zebra"  
LT  
ghci> 5 >= 2  
True  
ghci> 5 `compare` 3  
GT  
```

- Members of `Show` can be presented as strings. All types covered so far except for functions are a part of `Show`. The most used function that deals with the `Show` typeclass is `show`. It takes a value whose type is a member of `Show` and presents it to us as a string.

```hs
ghci> show 3  
"3"  
ghci> show 5.334  
"5.334"  
ghci> show True  
"True"  
```

- `Read` is sort of the opposite typeclass of `Show`. The `read` function takes a string and returns a type which is a member of `Read`.

```hs
ghci> read "True" || False  
True  
ghci> read "8.2" + 3.8  
12.0  
ghci> read "5" - 2  
3  
ghci> read "[1,2,3,4]" ++ [3]  
[1,2,3,4,3]  
```

So far so good. Again, all types covered so far are in this typeclass. But what happens if we try to do just `read "4"`?

```hs
ghci> read "4"
*** Exception: Prelude.read: no parse
```

What GHCI is telling us here is that it doesn't know what we want in return. Notice that in the previous uses of read we did something with the result afterwards.

Let's take a look at the type signature of read.

```hs
ghci> :t read  
read :: (Read a) => String -> a 
```
See? It returns a type that's part of `Read` but if we don't try to use it in some way later, it has no way of knowing which type. That's why we can use explicit `type annotations`. Type annotations are a way of explicitly saying what the type of an expression should be. We do that by adding `::` at the end of the expression and then specifying a type.

```hs
ghci> read "5" :: Int  
5  
ghci> read "5" :: Float  
5.0  
ghci> (read "5" :: Float) * 4  
20.0  
ghci> read "[1,2,3,4]" :: [Int]  
[1,2,3,4]  
ghci> read "(3, 'a')" :: (Int, Char)  
(3, 'a')  
```
